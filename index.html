      <p>
        The Foundation for Enlightened Society (FES) is a non-profit organization based in Boulder, CO, supporting the transmission of the practicing lineages of the Tibetan Rimé tradition, especially the Kagyu, Nyingma, and Shambhala lineages of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche.

        <h2>Current Initiatives</h2>
        <p>
          Our goal is to ensure that the precious lineages we have received continue robustly into the future.<br>
          To that end, we are currently focused on meeting the needs of newer and younger practitioners.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Supporting newer tantrikas and sadhakas by coordinating ngöndro practice, feasts, and lungs.
            We are especially focused on getting ready for the 2024 Vajrayogini Abhisheka in Halifax and offering continuing education and practice opportunities following its conclusion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Providing seminary transcripts and other materials to participants in the 3 Yanas Retreat at Drala Mountain Center.
            If you would like to donate Seminary transcripts or Profound Treasury volumes, see the Donations section below!
          </li>
          <li>
            Offering programming and resources for newer practitioners of Buddhist and Shambhala paths such as study and discussion groups,
            and opportunities to practice presenting the dharma to an audience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Receiving and distributing dharma materials such as texts, liturgies, and ritual objects.
            If you would like to donate such materials, we are both building up a library and passing on objects to those who can use them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Providing training in administrative roles within the Buddhist world through volunteering and
